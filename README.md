# Topp Furnace // Yelstream

Selected aspects of concurrency, asynchronous operation, reactive programming, virtual threads and nonblocking I/O.


## Introduction

Welcome to the Topp Furnace library,
a growing collection of utilities and enhancements for asynchronous operation and nonblocking I/O.
This project aims to provide high-quality,
reusable components to help developers create maintainable and efficient software.

As a professional software developer with a passion for all things Java,
I have compiled this library to encapsulate best practices and useful functionalities
that address common development needs.
My focus is on ensuring loose coupling and high cohesion,
leading to the creation of coherent libraries that can be easily integrated into your projects.

### Scope

Addressed is selected functionalities for asynchronous operation and nonblocking I/O.

As a foundation of most elements, I use Lombok, SLF4J, Java SE 9 modules and Java SE 21.

Started March 2024.

### Naming

The naming _Furnace_ is a reference to the dynamic and powerful processing capabilities essential for 
concurrency, asynchronous operation, reactive programming, virtual threads, and nonblocking I/O.
